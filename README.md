🧩 Emogrid
This was my final project for the CSS Grid module. I didn’t fully grasp every concept, and I’m not completely confident with it yet but instead of staying stuck, I decided to move forward and return to it later. 
The layout felt a bit bland at first, so I added a gradient background, gave it a title, smoothed out the boxes with border-radius, and shipped it as-is. Progress over perfection. I’d rather keep building than get frozen trying to make it flawless.

🛠️ What I Customized
🎨 Gradient background added for visual depth 🖋️ Custom font ("Shooting Star") downloaded and integrated via @font-face 
🧊 Border-radius applied to emoji tiles for smoother feel 
📱 Responsive layout tested across screen sizes

🚀 Tools Used
HTML5 & CSS3 CSS Grid VSCode + Live Server

🙌 Why This Matters
This project helped me push through confusion, trust my instincts, keep momentum going and keep on chucking forward. It’s a reminder: ship what you have, reflect later, and keep building.
